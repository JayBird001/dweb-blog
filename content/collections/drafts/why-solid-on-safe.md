## Why SAFE Network?

The SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network is more than a decentralised web, and quite different from other projects that aim to 'decentralise the web'.

I've been interested in decentralisation since 2014 and as ever more decentralisation projects have emerged, this is the one that remains outstanding in all respects: ambition, vision, values and technical excellence.

Since 2016 I've been building on the alpha networks so I understand the principles, potential and the team. It takes a while to understand the scope, ambition and technical promise of SAFE Network, but that's what sets it apart, so dig in!

## Why Solid?

The web has become centralised: a few large corporations handle most of the traffic. Information about everyone is routinely collected, sold and put to a wide range of uses that are damaging to individuals and important aspects of our society.

This is a long way from the open, inclusive vision of the web's creator Tim Berners-Lee which lead him to give his inventions away rather than try to commercialise them.

Solid is Tim Berners-Lee's attempt to correct this, and when combined with the security, privacy and freedom of SAFE Network, I think there is a real chance that together we can make a more open, free and creative future.

## Why Solid on SAFE?

Solid de-couples applications from data, which is important

Solid alone is designed to operate on the existing web and internet, and is unable to address many of its problems.
