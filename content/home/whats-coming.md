# What's coming
- Posts introducing React-static, Solid and SAFE Network, three technolgies that provide a fast, secure internet where users own and control their data, and can communicate freely without intermediaries, data harvesting, data breaches etc.
- enhancement of the website's structure, styling through editing of the site's configuation, addition of components and so on, as I learn
- posts to accompany those changes so you can incorporate features youself

That's quite a lot so don't expect updates every week! I'm busy working on SAFE Drive too, and also have a life. But if you want this stuff, your feedback and encouragement will help it happen.
